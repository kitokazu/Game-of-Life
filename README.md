-checked for how to pause simulation (sleep())

Notes:
I could have definitely been more OO when coding.
The program will ask the user for all of the inputs.
I do not have error handling, so if the user enters something wrong the program will not handle it well.
If the rows and columns entered doesn't match the grid on the file, then the program will not handle it well.
I split up the simlulation into FileSimulation and Simulation depending on whether the user enters a file or not.
